## Other Code Sources
For the database of recipe keywords, part of the DB was gathered from this former project (this was mainly to save time with typing): https://github.com/rojaswestall/cs337/blob/master/project2/kb.json

For the vegetarian and non-vegetarian functions, part of the DBs were gathered from this former project for the same reason: https://github.com/amitadate/EECS-337-NLP-Project-02/blob/master/Final_Submission/transformation_list.py?fbclid=IwAR3kkLEU2g6rs-h6_ujLkpmh6vL4znWXgO-zsUU8BTeoz2ypWNQlMchiRFM

For the interface, inspiration was taken from https://github.com/tylrodg/CS337-Recipes/blob/master/interface.py
